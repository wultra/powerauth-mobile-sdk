 * <pre>
 * code without signature:  CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 * code with signature:     CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC#BASE64_STRING_WITH_SIGNATURE
 *
 * recovery code:           CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 * recovery code from QR:   R:CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 *
 * recovery PUK:            DDDDDDDDDD
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>
 *       Where {@code C} is Base32 sequence of characters, fully decodable into the sequence of bytes.
 *       The validator then compares CRC-16 checksum calculated for the first 10 bytes and compares
 *       it to last two bytes (in big endian order).
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *       Where {@code D} is digit (0 - 9)
 *   </li>
