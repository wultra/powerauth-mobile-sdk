/**
 * The {@code Password} is an object representing an arbitrary passphrase. The underlying implementation
 * guarantees that the sensitive information is cleared from the memory when the object is destroyed.
 *
 * <h2>Discussion</h2>
 * <p>
 * Working with an user's passphrases is always a very delicate task. The good implementation should
 * always follow several well known rules, for example:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>Should minimize traces of the plaintext passphrase in the memory</li>
 *   <li>Should not allow serialization of sensitive information to the persistent storage</li>
 *   <li>Should keep the plaintext passphrase in memory as short as possible</li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Achieving all these principles together is usually very difficult, especially in managed
 * environments, like Java or Objective-C is. For exmaple, you can find a plenty of examples
 * in the past where the system keyboard leaked the passphrases, usually into the dynamic
 * dictionary used by keyboard's auto-complete feature.
 * <p>
 * Moreover, all these managed environments uses immutable strings for a string concatenation.
 * The result is that one simple user's passphrase is copied in hundred versions over the
 * whole process memory.
 * <p>
 * Due to this quirks, this PowerAuth library implementation provides its own custom objects
 * responsible for manipulation with passwords. You can use these objects in several, very
 * different scenarios, and its  only up to you which one you'll choose for your application:
 *
 * <h3>1. Wrapping an already complete passphrase</h3>
 * <p>
 * This is the simplest scenario, where you can simply create a Password object with a final
 * passphrase. You can use constructors with string or byte array parameters to do this.
 * In this situation, you typically leaving an entering the passphrase on the system components,
 * with all its advantages (easy to use) and disadvantages (usually not very secure).
 *
 * <h3>2. Using mutable PIN passphrase</h3>
 * <p>
 * If only the digits are allowed, then it's very recommended to create a custom UI interface
 * for a PIN keyboard and use the mutable Password object as the backing storage for
 * the passphrase.
 *
 * <h3>3. Using mutable alphanumeric passphrase</h3>
 * <p>
 * This approach is achievable, but usually very difficult to implement. Handling all the events
 * from the keyboard properly, is not an easy task, but the benefits are obvious.
 * At the end, you can get benefits from a supporting very strong passphrases and also
 * you'll minimize all traces of the passphrase in the memory.
