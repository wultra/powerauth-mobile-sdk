# This configuration contains default parameters for an instrumentation tests that run
# against the PowerAuth stack installed locally. To use your own configuration, please
# save your modifications to "private-instrumentation-tests.properties". The private
# configuration file is preferred over the default one and is already added to the gitignore.

# Be aware that this configuration also doesn't work out of the box. You should replace
# 'localhost' with your machine's IP address. The 'localhost' from Android Emulator's perspective
# is the emulator itself, so it would not work.
