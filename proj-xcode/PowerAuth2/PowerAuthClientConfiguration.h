 WARNING
 
 This protocol allows you to tweak the requests created in the PowerAuthSDK, but
 also gives you an opportunity to break the things. So, rather than create your own interceptor,
 try to contact us and describe what's your problem with the networking in the PowerAuth SDK.
 
 Also note, that this interface may change in the future. We can guarantee the API stability of
 public classes implementing this interface, but not the stability of interface itself.
