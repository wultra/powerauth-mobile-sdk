 WARNING
 
 This property is exposed only for the purpose of giving developers full low-level control over the cryptographic algorithm and
 managed activation state. For example, you can call a direct password change method without prior check of the password correctness
 in cooperation with the server API. Be extremely careful when calling any methods of this instance directly. There are very few
 protective mechanisms for keeping the session state actually consistent in the functional (not low level) sense. As a result, you
 may break your activation state (for example, by changing password from incorrect value to some other value).

#pragma mark - Request synchronization

@interface PowerAuthSDK (RequestSync)

/**
 Executes provided block on an internal, serialized operation queue. This gives application an opportunity to serialize
 its own signed HTTP requests, with requests created in the SDK internally.
 
 @b Why this matters
 
 The PowerAuth SDK is using that executor for serialization of signed HTTP requests, to guarantee, that only one request is processed
 at the time. The PowerAuth signatures are based on a logical counter, so this technique makes that all requests are delivered
 to the server in the right order. So, if the application is creating its own signed requests, then it's recommended to synchronize
 them with the SDK.
 
 @b Recommended practices
 
 1)  You should calculate PowerAuth signature from the execute block method.
 
 2)  You have to always call `task.cancel()` on provided `PowerAuthOperationTask` object once the operation is finished,
     otherwise the seriali queue will be blocked indefinitely.
