 Discussion
 
 Note that the method is thread safe, but it's not recommended to request for the same token
 name in parallel when the token is not stored in local database yet. If the method returns
 an asynchronous task, then the pending HTTP request to the server has been issued, so you
 should not ask for the same token while the task is in processing. You can use `-hasLocalTokenWithName:`
 method to check, whether the token is already in the local database.

 block was executed synchronously. That typically happens when token is locally present
 and available (e.g. doesn't need to be acquired from the server) or in case of error.

 In this case, it's expected that token is already cached on iPhone and therefore the authentication

 On iOS, method always returns invalid parameter error.
