 On watchOS, the PA2WatchSynchronizationService class is responsible for processing
 ALL requests received from the iPhone. Unlike on the iPhone, we're not registering particular
 instances of SDK objects to the PA2WCSessionManager, but using just one service for all purposes.
 
 The reason for this is fact, that both PowerAuthWatchSDK and its internal token store are accessing
 data directly from the keychain and therefore the keychain is the only synchronized storage.
