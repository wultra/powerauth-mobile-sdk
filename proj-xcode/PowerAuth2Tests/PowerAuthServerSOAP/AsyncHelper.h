/**
 AsyncHelper allows you to linearize execution of any asynchronous operation.
 The typical usage pattern for this class looks like this:
 
	 id result = [AsyncHelper synchronizeAsynchronousBlock:^(AsyncHelper * waiting) {
		// Start any asynchronous operation in the block
		Operation * op = [YourClass yourAsyncOperation:^(BOOL success) {
			// This is a completion block for your async operation
			[waiting reportCompletion:@"SUCCESS"];
		}];
		[op start];
	 }];
	 NSLog(@"Operation ended with %@", result);		// Will print: "Operation ended with: SUCCESS"

 WARNING: Do not use this class in the production application. The internal implementation is
          sufficient for the testing purposes, but it's still kind of multithread anti-pattern.

 Creates a new instance of AsyncHelper and immediately executes the provided block.

 the completion in predefined time (10 seconds), then the exception is thrown.
