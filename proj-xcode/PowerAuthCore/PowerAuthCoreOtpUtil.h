/** 
 The `PowerAuthCoreOtpUtil` class provides various set of methods for parsing and validating
 activation or recovery codes.
 
 Current format:
 ------------------
 code without signature:    CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 code with signature:       CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC#BASE64_STRING_WITH_SIGNATURE
 
 recovery code:             CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 recovery code from QR:     R:CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC-CCCCC
 
 recovery PUK:              DDDDDDDDDD
 
 - Where the 'C' is Base32 sequence of characters, fully decodable into the sequence of bytes.
   The validator then compares CRC-16 checksum calculated for the first 10 bytes and compares
   it to last two bytes (in big endian order).
 
 - Where the 'D' is digit (0 - 9)
 
 As you can see, both activation and recovery codes, shares the same basic principle (like CRC16
 checksum). That's why parser returns the same `PowerAuthCoreOtp` object for both scenarios.

 Validates an input |utfCodepoint| and returns '\0' (NUL) if it's not valid or cannot be corrected.
