/**
 The PowerAuthCorePassword is an object representing an arbitrary passphrase. The underlying implementation
 guarantees that the sensitive information is cleared from the memory when the object is destroyed.
 
 
 Discussion
 
 Working with an user's passphrases is always a very delicate task. The good implementation should
 always follow several well known rules, for example:
 
    1. Should minimize traces of the plaintext passphrase in the memory
    2. Should not allow serialization of sensitive information to the persistent storage
    3. Should keep the plaintext passphrase in memory as short as possible
 
 Achieving all these principles together is usually very difficult, especially in managed
 environments, like Java or Objective-C is. For exmaple, you can find a plenty of examples 
 in the past where the system keyboard leaked the passphrases, usually into the dynamic
 dictionary used by keyboard's auto-complete feature.
 
 Moreover, all these managed environments uses immutable strings for a string concatenation. 
 The result is that one simple user's passphrase is copied in hundred versions over the 
 whole process memory.
 
 Due to this quirks, this PowerAuth library implementation provides its own custom objects
 responsible for manipulation with passwords. You can use these objects in several, very
 different scenarios, and its  only up to you which one you'll choose for your application:
 
 
 1. Wrapping an already complete passphrase
 
 This is the simplest scenario, where you can simply create a PowerAuthCorePassword object with a final
 passphrase. You can use 'passwordWithString' or 'passwordWithData' methods to do this.
 In this situation, you typically leaving an entering the passphrase on the system components,
 with all its advantages (easy to use) and disadvantages (usually not very secure).
 
 
 2. Using mutable PIN passphrase
 
 If onyl the digits are allowed, then it's very recommended to create a custom UI interface 
 for a PIN keyboard and use the PowerAuthCoreMutablePassword object as the backing storage for 
 the passphrase.
 
 
 3. Using mutable alphanumeric passphrase
 
 This approach is achievable, but usually very difficult to implement. Handling all the events
 from the keyboard properly, is not an easy task, but the benefits are obvious. 
 At the end, you can get benefits from a supporting very strong passphrases and also 
 you'll minimize all traces of the passphrase in the memory.
