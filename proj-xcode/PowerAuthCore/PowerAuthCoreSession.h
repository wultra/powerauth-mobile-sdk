 Discussion
 
 If the operation succeeds then the PowerAuth handshake is from a network communication point of view
 considered as complete. The server knows our client and both sides have calculated shared
 secret key. Because of the complexity of the operation, there's one more separate step in our
 activation flow, which finally protects all sensitive information with user password and
 other local keys. This last step is offline only, no data is transmitted over the network
 and therefore if you don't complete the activation (you can reset session for example)
 then the server will keep its part of shared secret but nobody will be able to use that
 estabilished context.

/**
 Changes user's password. You have to save session's state to keep this change for later.
 
 The method doesn't perform old password validation and therefore, if the wrong password is provided,
 then the internal knowledge key will be permanently lost. Before calling this method, you have to validate
 old password by calling some server's endpoint, which requires at least knowledge factor for completion.
 
 So, the typical flow for password change has a following steps:
 
 1. ask user for an old password
 2. send HTTP request, signed with knowledge factor, use an old password for key unlock
    - if operation fails, then you can repeat step 1 or exit the flow
 3. ask user for a new password as usual (e.g. ask for passwd for twice, compare both,
    check minimum length, entropy, etc...)
 4. call `changeUserPassword` with old and new password
 5. save session's state

 All this, is just a preliminary proposal functionality and is not covered by PowerAuth specification.
