 The additional encryption key is useful in  multibanking applications, where it allows the

 perform additional encryption / decryption operations when the signature keys are being used.
 
 The session implements a couple of simple protections against misuse of this feature and therefore
 once the session is activated with the EEK, then you have to use that EEK for all future cryptographic
 operations. The key is NOT serialized in the session's state and thus it's up to the application,
 how it manages the chain of multiple PowerAuth sessions.

 Discussion

 Internally, the underlying Session keeps keys for signature computation always encrypted
 and doesn't expose these from the outside of the class. This very strict approach is
 a prevention against accidental sensitive information leakage. Your application has
 control only over the keys, which actually encrypts and decrypts this sensitive information.
 
 At first read, it looks like that this additional protection layer has no cryptographic benefit
 at all. Yes, this is basically true :) The purpose of this layer is just to simplify the Session's
 interface. In this approach, the exact state of the session is always fully serializable and the
 only application's responsibility is to provide the lock / unlock keys in the right time, 
 when these are really required. 
 
 As you can see, you still need to take care about how you're working with these unlock keys.
 Check the details below, each key type has its own rules how to construct the key or
